# Antenna Azimuth Mapper

A small command-line tool — and a Cowork/Claude Code skill built on top of
it — that plots one or more compass azimuths (e.g. for aiming a directional
antenna) from a GPS point onto a satellite-image snapshot, and reports a
best-effort estimate of any obstruction near the line based on shadows
detected in the image.

There is no live GPS sensor in a Claude/Cowork session, so coordinates are
supplied by the user (e.g. pasted from a phone's maps app "share location"
feature) rather than read from a device.

## Setup

```bash
cd antenna-azimuth-mapper
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

No API key is required — imagery comes from Esri's public World Imagery
basemap.

## Usage

```bash
python -m azimuth_mapper.cli \
  --lat 50.0755 --lon 14.4378 \
  --azimuth 45 --distance 2000 --label "Site A" \
  --azimuth 120 --distance 1500 --beamwidth 30 --label "Sector 2" \
  --out map.html
```

- `--azimuth` is repeatable — one ray (or sector wedge, with `--beamwidth`)
  per value.
- `--distance` accepts one value applied to every azimuth, or one value per
  `--azimuth`, in meters (default 1000 m).
- `--beamwidth` (degrees) draws a sector wedge instead of a single ray —
  useful for planning a directional/sector antenna's coverage cone. Unlike
  `--distance`, it does **not** broadcast: if you use it at all with more
  than one `--azimuth`, pass exactly one `--beamwidth` per `--azimuth`, in
  the same order, using `""` or `none` for the rays that should stay plain
  lines — e.g. `--azimuth 45 --beamwidth "" --azimuth 120 --beamwidth 30`.
  `--label` works the same way when used with multiple azimuths.
- `--capture-datetime` (ISO 8601 UTC, e.g. `2026-06-21T12:00:00`) sets the
  date/time assumed for the sun-position calculation used in the shadow
  estimate. Defaults to the current time, since the actual capture date of
  a public satellite basemap tile isn't published.
- Open the resulting HTML file in a browser, or hand it to the `Artifact`
  tool from a Claude session to publish it inline.

Run the tests with:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Accuracy & limitations

**The azimuth ray itself is exact geodesic math** (forward geodesic from the
given origin), independent of the imagery.

**The shadow-based estimate is a heuristic, not a certified measurement.**
Rigorous photogrammetric correction of satellite imagery (relief
displacement / collinearity) needs the sensor's exterior orientation for
the exact image used — its viewing (off-nadir) angle and azimuth at capture
time. Public satellite basemaps (Esri World Imagery, Mapbox, Google) are
mosaics of tiles from different source images and different dates, and none
of that per-tile geometry is exposed through their tile APIs. This tool
does **not** invent that number.

What it does instead, and what it reports:

1. Detects elongated dark blobs near the origin point in the fetched image
   (`shadow_detect.py` — an OpenCV threshold + contour heuristic).
2. Computes the astronomically-true sun azimuth/elevation for the given
   location and the assumed capture date/time (`solar.py` — a standard
   low-precision solar position formula, no external data needed).
3. If a detected blob's orientation is close to the sun-opposite direction
   expected for a real shadow, it reports the shadow's length and, from
   classic shadow trigonometry (`length * tan(sun elevation)`), an
   **estimated height** of whatever cast it — flagged with a confidence
   level and how many degrees off the expected shadow direction it was.

That height estimate is genuinely computed from the image and true solar
geometry, but it is still approximate: the assumed capture date/time may be
wrong (basemap imagery is typically weeks to years old), the detected blob
might not be the feature nearest your line of interest, and low sun
elevation makes the length-to-height conversion noisy. Treat it as a
"there may be an obstruction of roughly this height near this bearing"
signal, not a survey-grade figure — and never as a claim about which way an
object leans in the image, since that direction is not recoverable without
the sensor's viewing azimuth.

## Layout

- `azimuth_mapper/geometry.py` — geodesic math (destination point, bearing,
  distance) and Web Mercator tile/pixel math.
- `azimuth_mapper/solar.py` — sun azimuth/elevation for a place and UTC time.
- `azimuth_mapper/imagery.py` — fetches and stitches Esri World Imagery
  tiles around a point.
- `azimuth_mapper/shadow_detect.py` — finds candidate shadow blobs.
- `azimuth_mapper/correction.py` — turns a shadow + sun position into a
  bounded height estimate (see limitations above).
- `azimuth_mapper/render.py` — builds the self-contained HTML output (image
  embedded as a data URI, azimuth rays/wedges and legend as inline SVG).
- `azimuth_mapper/cli.py` — command-line entry point.
- `.claude/skills/azimuth-satellite/SKILL.md` — the Cowork/Claude Code
  skill that drives this conversationally.
