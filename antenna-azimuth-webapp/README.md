# Antenna Azimuth Mapper — Web App

A real-time web app that plots compass azimuths (e.g. for aiming a
directional or sector antenna) from your **live browser GPS position** onto
a satellite map, and corrects those bearings for the angle the imagery was
shot from, so a target picked off a mast top or rooftop points where it
really is.

**Live demo:** https://antenna-azimuth-webapp.vercel.app

This is the browser-based companion to
[`../antenna-azimuth-mapper`](../antenna-azimuth-mapper), which is a
CLI/Cowork-skill version of the same idea for use inside a Claude session
(no device GPS there, so coordinates are typed in). This app exists
specifically for the piece the CLI/skill can't do: continuous, real GPS
tracking straight from your phone or laptop's browser.

## Setup

```bash
cd antenna-azimuth-webapp
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). No API key or `.env`
file is needed — satellite imagery comes from Esri's public World Imagery
basemap.

**GPS requires HTTPS** (or `localhost`) — `navigator.geolocation` is blocked
by browsers on a plain-HTTP, non-localhost origin. Local dev on `localhost`
works fine; once deployed (e.g. to Vercel) HTTPS is automatic.

## Usage

1. Allow the location permission prompt — your position appears as a white
   dot and the map recenters on it.
2. Add one or more azimuths (degrees, 0 = north) with a distance; give one
   a beamwidth to draw a sector wedge instead of a line, for planning a
   directional/sector antenna's coverage cone.
3. Calibrate the imagery once per site: mark an upright object's base and
   apparent top, then enter its height or press **From shadow** to measure
   it. Pick targets with **Pick target on map** and give each a height above
   ground to see its corrected bearing.
4. If GPS is unavailable or you want to check a different spot, type
   coordinates directly into the Latitude/Longitude fields — this switches
   to a manual override; "Use live GPS instead" switches back.

## What is and isn't distorted

The azimuth rays themselves are exact geodesic math from your GPS
coordinates. A satellite basemap and a vector basemap are both Web Mercator,
north-up, on the same tile grid, and a bearing here is computed from
latitude and longitude rather than from pixels — so **for two points on the
ground the azimuth is identical on either layer.** There is nothing to
correct there, and this app doesn't pretend otherwise.

What genuinely is displaced is anything standing *above* the ground.
Orthorectification places the terrain correctly using a bare-earth model,
but a mast, a rooftop or a chimney isn't in that model: its top is imaged
along the slanted line of sight to the satellite and lands away from its
true ground position by

    d = h · cot(E_sat)      along bearing   A_sat + 180°

where `h` is height above ground and `E_sat` / `A_sat` are the satellite's
elevation and azimuth. Picking an antenna link's far end by its mast top —
the normal way to pick it — therefore gives a bearing that's off. At 30 m
height and 30° off-nadir that's about 17 m of displacement: roughly **2° of
azimuth error at 500 m, 5° at 200 m**, and asymptotically nothing at long
range.

## How the correction works

`E_sat` and `A_sat` aren't published per tile, but they can be recovered
from the image, because a shadow and a lean are the same radial geometry
with the sun swapped for the satellite:

    shadow:  L_shadow = h · cot(E_sun),  bearing A_sun + 180°
    lean:    L_lean   = h · cot(E_sat),  bearing A_sat + 180°

The sun's position is computed astronomically, so measuring a reference
object's shadow gives its height `h`; with `h` known, that same object's
observed lean gives the satellite geometry. In the app: mark one upright
object's **base** and its **apparent top**, supply its height (or press
**From shadow** to measure it), and every elevated target you pick then gets
a corrected bearing alongside the raw one.

**Caveats worth keeping in mind.** The shadow measurement is a heuristic —
it detects an elongated dark blob and checks its direction against the true
sun, which is a sanity check rather than a guarantee it found the right
object; entering a known height by hand is more reliable. A calibration is
only valid for the patch of imagery it was measured on, since a basemap is a
mosaic of images from different passes. Ground-level targets need no
correction at all. And a separate real-world error source this app can't see
is basemap georeferencing offset — Esri's mosaic can sit several metres off
in places, which no amount of lean correction fixes.

## Layout

- `lib/geometry.ts`, `lib/solar.ts` — geodesic and solar-position math,
  ported 1:1 from the CLI's `azimuth_mapper/geometry.py` and `solar.py` so
  both tools agree.
- `lib/relief.ts` — the correction itself: recover the imagery's viewing
  geometry from one reference object, then map an apparent position back to
  its true ground position. Covered by `lib/relief.test.ts`.
- `components/AzimuthMap.tsx` — a `react-leaflet` map with an Esri World
  Imagery tile layer, your live GPS marker, the azimuth rays/wedges and the
  calibration/target markers (all computed client-side).
- `app/api/shadow-estimate/route.ts` (Node runtime — needs `sharp`) —
  server-side only, because reading pixel data from a cross-origin tile
  image in the browser would hit canvas CORS tainting: it fetches/stitches
  Esri tiles, decodes them, and runs the shadow-detection + sun-position
  heuristic (`lib/shadow.ts`, `lib/tiles.ts` — ported from the CLI's
  `shadow_detect.py`/`correction.py`/`imagery.py`, since there's no OpenCV
  here). It only runs on demand, to avoid hammering the public tile endpoint.
- `app/api/export/route.ts` — renders the current view as a self-contained
  SVG for filing or sending on.
- `lib/persist.ts` — session state in `localStorage`, and the shareable link
  (encoded in the URL fragment, so a shared position never reaches a server
  log).

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Vitest covers the geometry, solar and relief modules — including a
round-trip that synthesises a lean for a known satellite geometry and checks
the calibration recovers it, and the hand-worked 2°-at-500 m case above.

## Deployment

Running live at https://antenna-azimuth-webapp.vercel.app. To deploy your
own copy:

```bash
npx vercel --cwd antenna-azimuth-webapp
```

or connect the repo in the Vercel dashboard with **Root Directory** set to
`antenna-azimuth-webapp`. No environment variables are required.

Note that Vercel enables **Vercel Authentication** on new projects, which
makes the deployment reachable only by members of the owning team — turn it
off under *Project Settings → Deployment Protection* if you want the URL to
be publicly usable (e.g. to open it on a phone that isn't logged into
Vercel).
